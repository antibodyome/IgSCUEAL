IgSCUEAL
========

This collection of [HyPhy](/veg/hyphy), Python, and JavaScript (d3) scripts is a working version of a pipeline to process Immunoglobulins B-cell transcript sequences. It is adapted from our genetic algorithm for HIV-1 subtyping [SCUEAL](http://www.ploscompbiol.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pcbi.1000581), hence the name

IgSCUEAL uses Bower for package management, and for optimal performance, it should be run using the MPI version of HyPhy on a cluster.

See the [wiki](/spond/IgSCUEAL/wiki) for (some) documentation, and usage examples.
